            # your scanner with useDelimiter ( "[\\.\\?\\!]|\\Z" ) .
        # 3. Split the sentence into words, stripping out punctuation and making the words lowercase.
        """
        Notes:
            An easy way to strip out punctuation is to use replaceAll ( \\W+, "" ) .
            The String class has a split() method. If you split around "\\s+" you will be splitting the
            sentence around whitespace characters.
            The LMS has an example of how to read URLâ€™s.

        A public method that computes the Cosine Similatity of two words. If you look at the formula above,
        you see that there are three sums computed: one vector dot product, and two vector magnitudes.
        The correct way to tackle this is to write two private methods to make these calculations.
        There is one special case: word1 or word2 might not appear anywhere in the corpus. If this is true,
        your method should return a similarity value of -1.0 .
